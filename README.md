# .NET AES IGE -- Infinite Garble Extension

This repository is for one of my projects, primarily focusing on research around AES encryption, as well as extending it with IGE (Infinite Garble Extension), a specific block cipher mode for AES in which each plaintext block depends on both the previous plaintext and ciphertext blocks.

Although it is a less common encryption mode, IGE provides a particularly interesting tamper-proof approach, which could be used for encrypting video or voice calls and may even find applications in secure, military-grade communication systems.
